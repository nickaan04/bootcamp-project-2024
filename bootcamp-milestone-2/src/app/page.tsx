              Hello! My name is Nickaan Jahadi and I am a
              <strong>third year computer engineering major</strong>. I grew up
              in San Diego and love nutrition, working out, and playing/watching
              sports, especially basketball, boxing, and MMA.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got into programming my senior year of high school and am still
              deciding whether I wanna pursue software, hardware, or both. I am
              very new to web development, so this starter pack was definitely a
              good start.
            </p>
